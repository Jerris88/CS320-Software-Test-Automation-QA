*How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

In order to ensure that my code is functional and secure is first and foremost keep a non-biased view when writing my code. When developing my code I should follow industry best standards and practices, ensuring that my code features clear naming schemes, is well commented, and resuseable. My code methods should feature proper error handling to validate input and prevent injection attacks. It is common and necessary for most developers to implement incremental unit testing to validate their code. By unit testing every method and all possible branches, I can ensure that my code is both functional and secure.

*How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

In order to interpret user needs I evaluate what functionality they hope to get out of the program. This can be done through an interview or by reviewing project requirement documents. I then create a high level view of the program where those specific user expectations are translated into application features and functionality. From there I can begin to develop pseudocode translating application features into actual code methods.

*How do I approach designing software?

The early stages of software design relies on gathering and evaluating project requirements. After those requirements have been translated into actual application features, pre-planning work such as pseduocode development can begin. After the planning phase has been completed, the actual code development begins. While developing the code, end-user requirements should be kept in mind. Code should be clear, secure, and maintainable. Proper error handling should be included for all methods with inputs and input validation and sanitation should be implemented to reduce injection vulnerabilities. While developing code, I will always make sure to incorporate incremental unit testing for all of my methods to ensure that the code is functioning and secure.
